Course Outline Tool Implementation - Progress Summary
=========================================================

Overview:
Added a second tool alongside the existing content search tool to handle course outline queries.

Steps Completed:
================

1. Vector Store Enhancement (backend/vector_store.py:268-298)
   - Added get_course_outline() method
   - Resolves course names using semantic search
   - Returns structured course data: title, link, instructor, and lesson list
   - Handles JSON parsing of lesson metadata from ChromaDB

2. Course Outline Tool Implementation (backend/search_tools.py:128-190)
   - Created CourseOutlineTool class implementing Tool interface
   - Tool definition for Anthropic API with course_name input parameter
   - Execute method that calls vector store and formats results
   - Formatted output includes course details and numbered lesson list

3. Tool Registration (backend/rag_system.py:7,25,27)
   - Imported CourseOutlineTool in RAG system
   - Created outline_tool instance with vector_store dependency
   - Registered new tool alongside existing search tool

4. System Prompt Update (backend/ai_generator.py:8-36)
   - Updated AI system prompt to describe both available tools
   - Added specific usage instructions:
     * search_course_content: For specific course content queries
     * get_course_outline: For course structure/lesson list queries
   - Maintained existing response protocols and formatting guidelines

Functionality:
==============
The new tool handles course outline queries by:
- Input: Course title (partial matches supported)
- Output: Course title, course link, instructor, and complete lesson list
- Data source: Course metadata from vector store's catalog collection
- Integration: Fully registered and available to AI assistant

Technical Notes:
================
- All files compile without syntax errors
- Tool follows existing patterns and interfaces
- Maintains separation of concerns between search and outline functions
- Uses existing vector store infrastructure for course name resolution
